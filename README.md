# rnaseq-in-R
Rnaseq analysis_code snippets from three datasets

This is code repo Systems Biol 1 and 2 module. 

In January, 2019 we analysed 3 datasets in Phantasus. Now, we repeat the same exercise via R codes.

Additionally, featurecount, Kallisto, and mmquant pipeline is also presented. Which generates the GEM dataset in the first place.

In all, it's a complete pipeline for rnaseq analysis from reads to data analysis in R.
